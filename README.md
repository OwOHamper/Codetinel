## Inspiration
What inspired us was the actual process of developing this product. With our wall being fully covered in sticky notes we were coding and designing our ideas into the reality. Many things took much more longer as expected, we've struggled with lot of errors and miscommunication. But our mentors and people from Telekom were amazing. They have not only provided us with a great feedback, but also encouraged us to push even more. Another inspiration was making it real. Seeing the ideas working for the first time, no matter how small they were, was truly incredible. When designing the UI of "vulnerability page overview" we got inspired by a page called Flask. 

## What it does
Our product is a web tool utilizing AI agents. You upload your source code, the program will determine whether the vulnerabilities in your code are truly exploitable or not. Then you can visualize a detailed overview of the it (in what part of the code the error occurred + recommendations on how to fix it)

## How we built it

Tools used: Design: Canva
                   Programming: Python, FastAPI, LangChainðŸ¦œ, MongoDB, utilized LLM Agents 

## Challenges we ran into

**Miscommunication** - happened numerous times, we got our points in different ways, which resulted in creation of different things  

**Brainfog** - there was a part of our project where nothing has seemed to keep improving. We felt stuck, rotating in the cycles, talking about the same things and not able to found solutions. 


## Accomplishments that we're proud of

**Building the back-end logic**
**Building the AI** - Teo and Jacob did amazing job of doing this 
**Building the error overview** - Thomas and Mark did great job of designing the front-end of it, which was actually trickier than it looked

## What we learned

**Start small** - sometimes we were trying to start really big. Trying to solve really complex things or to even multitask. But the best way is to just experiment with small solutions and figuring out how to scale them.

**Seek feedback as soon as you can** - A majority of our problems started to get solved much quickly when we started to communicate between ourselves more often and requesting feedback not only from our team members, but also from mentors.

**Don't be afraid to ask, use mentors as your learning material" - Mentors are excited to always help, our lesson is to just ask more and request feedback from them more often. Their insights were really helpful and it saved us a lot of time. 

## What's next for Codetinel - GigaCHAT - 2

We want to focus on 2 things: 

1) Automation: CI/CD with automatic deployment of testing environments
2) Making the Tool Accessible for Managers: Creating a manager-friendly view in the vulnerability overview
